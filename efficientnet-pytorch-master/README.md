# EfficientNet
PyTorch implementation for:

[EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946)

Note:
- I have not yet got the result like a paper.
- And I publish the experimental results of CIFAR-100, so please take a look [here](https://www.comet.ml/katsura-jp/efficientnet) .
